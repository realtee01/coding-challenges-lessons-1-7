5 Practical Coding Challenges (Lessons 1-7)

Date: February 2, 2026

This repo has my solutions for 5 JavaScript coding challenges covering variable scope, conditionals, arrays, functions, and loops.

 Challenges

Challenge 1: Variable Scope Exploration
- File: challenge1-variable-scope.js
- Figured out how let works with loops and why variables declared inside loops aren't accessible outside
- The counter ends at 6, not 5, because it increments one last time before failing the condition

Challenge 2: Logical Operators Challenge  
- File: challenge2-logical-operators.js
- Built an age verification system with different rules for different age groups
- Learned to handle multiple conditions with AND/OR operators
- Added specific error messages so users know exactly why they were denied

Challenge 3: Array Modification Practice
- File: challenge3-array-modification.js
- Tested what you can and can't do with const arrays
- Turns out you can push, pop, and change elements but you can't reassign the whole array
- Got a TypeError when I tried to reassign it

Challenge 4: Function Return Values Lab
- File: challenge4-function-returns.js
- Made a calculator with 3 functions that work together
- Learned that forgetting return makes the function give back undefined
- Practiced chaining functions by passing results from one into another

Challenge 5: Array Loop Analysis Challenge
- File: challenge5-array-analysis.js
- Analyzed test scores in one loop instead of multiple loops
- Found passing/failing counts, highest, lowest, and average all at once
- Had to initialize highest and lowest with actual array values, not 0 or 100
